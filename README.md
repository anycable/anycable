# Anycable

AnyCable allows you to use any WebSocket server (written in any language) as a replacement for your Ruby server (such as Faye, ActionCable, etc).

AnyCable uses ActionCable protocol, so you can use ActionCable [JavaScript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actioncable) without any monkey-patching.

**NOTE**: Since version 0.4.0 this repository contains only core functionality and connot be used separately as is.
Rails plug-n-play integration has been extracted to [anycable-rails](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-rails) gem.

## Configuration

Anycable uses [anyway_config](https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config), thus it is also possible to set configuration variables through `secrets.yml` or environment vars.

## ActionCable Compatibility

This is the compatibility list for the AnyCable gem, not for AnyCable servers (which may not support some of the features yet).
