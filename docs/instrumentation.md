# AnyCable-Go Instrumentation

AnyCable-Go provides useful statistical information about the service (such as the number of connected clients, received messages, etc.).

## Metrics and what can we learn from them

Instrumentation exists to help us preventing and identifying performance issues. Here we provide the list of the most crucial metrics and how to interpret their values.

**NOTE:** Some values are updated at real time, others (_interval metrics_) are updated periodically (every 5 seconds by default, could be configured via the `stats_refresh_interval` configuration parameter). Interval metrics are marked with the ‚è± icon below.

**NOTE:** The `*_total` metrics are _counters_; when printing metrics to logs, the delta between two subsequent metrics collections is displayed; Prometheus works with absolute (i.e., cumulative) values and interpolates them on its own.

### ‚è± `clients_num` / `clients_uniq_num`

The `clients_num` shows the current number of _active_ sessions (WebSocket connections). A session is considered activated as soon as it has been **authenticated** and until the connection is closed.

The `clients_uniq_num` shows the current number of unique _connection identifiers_ across the active sessions. A connection identifier is a combination of `identified_by` values for the corresponding Connection object.

One the useful derivative of these two metrics is the `clients_uniq_num` / `clients_num` ratio. If it's much less than 1 and is decreasing, that could be an indicator of an improper connection managements at the client side (e.g., creating a _client_ per a component mount or a Turbo navigation instead of re-using a singleton).

### `rpc_call_total`, `rpc_error_total`, `rpc_retries_total`, `rpc_pending_num`

These are the vital metrics of the RPC communication channel.

The `rpc_error_total` describes the number of failed RPC calls. This is the actual number of _commands_ that failed. The most common reason for the is a lack of network connectivity with the RPC service. Another potential reason is the RPC schema incompatibility (in that case, most RPC requests would fail, i.e., `rpc_call_total / rpc_error_total` tends to 1).

The `rpc_retries_total` describes the number of retried RPC calls. Retries could happen if the RPC server is exhausted or unavailable (no network connectivity). The former indicates that **concurrency settings for RPC and anycable-go went out of sync** (see [./configuration.md]).

The `rpc_pending_num` is the **key latency metrics** of AnyCable-Go. We limit the number of concurrent RPC requests (to prevent the RPC server exhaustion and retries). If the number of pending requests grows (which means we can not keep up with the rate of incoming messages), you should consider either tuning concurrency settings or scale up your cluster.

### `failed_auths_total`

This `failed_auths_total` indicates the total number of unauthenticated connection attempts and has a special purpose: it helps you identify misconfigured client credentials and malicious behaviour. Ideally, the change rate of this number should be low comparing to the `clients_num`.)

### ‚è± `disconnect_queue_size`

The `disconnect_queue_size` shows the current number of pending Disconnect calls. AnyCable-Go performs Disconnect calls in the background with some throttling (by default, 100 calls per second).

During the normal operation, the value should be close to zero most of the a time. Larger values or growth could indicate inefficient client-side connection management (high re-connection rate). Spikes could indicate mass disconnect events.

### ‚è± `goroutines_num`

The `goroutines_num` metrics is meant for debugging Go routines leak purposes. The number should be O(N), where N is the `clients_num` value for the OSS version and should be O(1) for the PRO version (unless IO polling is disabled).

## Prometheus

To enable a HTTP endpoint to serve [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)-compatible metrics (disabled by default) you must specify `--metrics_http` option (e.g. `--metrics_http="/metrics"`).

You can also change a listening port and listening host through `--metrics_port` and `--metrics_host` options respectively (by default the same as the main (websocket) server port and host, i.e., using the same server).

The exported metrics format is the following (NOTE: the list above is just an example and could be incomplete):

```sh

```

## StatsD

AnyCable also supports emitting real-time metrics to [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd).

For that, you must specify the StatsD server UDP host:

```sh
anycable-go -statsd_host=localhost:8125
```

Metrics are pushed with the `anycable_go.` prefix by default. You can override it by specifying the `statsd_prefix` parameter.

## Default metrics tags

You can define global tags (added to every reported metric by default) for Prometheus (reported as labels)
and StatsD. For example, we can add environment and node information:

```sh
anycable-go --metrics_tags=environment:production,node_id:xyz
# or via environment variables
ANYCABLE_METRICS_TAGS=environment:production,node_id:xyz anycable-go
```

For StatsD, you can specify tags format: "datadog" (default), "influxdb", or "graphite".
Use the `statsd_tag_format` configuration parameter for that.

## Logging

Another option is to periodically write stats to log (with `info` level).

To enable metrics logging pass `--metrics_log` flag.

Your logs should contain something like this:

```sh
INFO 2018-03-06T14:16:27.872Z broadcast_msg_total=0 broadcast_streams_num=0 client_msg_total=0 clients_num=0 clients_uniq_num=0 context=metrics disconnect_queue_size=0 failed_auths_total=0 failed_broadcast_msg_total=0 failed_client_msg_total=0 goroutines_num=35 rpc_call_total=0 rpc_error_total=0
```

By default, metrics are logged every 15 seconds (you can change this behavior through `--metrics_rotate_interval` option).

By default, all available metrics are logged. You can specify a subset of metrics to print to logs via the `--metrics_log_filter` option. For example:

```sh
$ anycable-go --metrics_log_filter=clients_num,rpc_call_total,rpc_error_total

...
INFO 2023-02-21T15:49:25.744Z context=metrics Log metrics every 15s (only selected fields: clients_num, rpc_call_total, rpc_error_total)
...
```

### Custom loggers with mruby

<!-- TODO: add new API, remove "experimental" -->

> üë®‚Äçüî¨ This is an experimental API and could change in the future üë©‚Äçüî¨

AnyCable-Go allows you to write custom log formatters using an embedded [mruby](http://mruby.org) engine.

mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language. Hence it is possible to use Ruby to write metrics exporters.

First, you should download the version of `anycable-go` with mruby (it's not included by default): these binaries have `-mrb` suffix right after the version (i.e. `anycable-go-1.0.0-mrb-linux-amd64`).

**NOTE**: only MacOS and Linux are supported.

**NOTE**: when a server with mruby support is starting you should the following message:

```sh
$ anycable-go

INFO 2019-08-07T16:37:46.387Z context=main Starting AnyCable v0.6.2-13-gd421927 (with mruby 1.2.0 (2015-11-17)) (pid: 1362)
```

Secondly, write a Ruby script implementing a simple interface:

```ruby
# Module MUST be named MetricsFormatter
module MetricsFormatter
  # The only required method is .call.
  #
  # It accepts the metrics Hash and MUST return a string
  def self.call(data)
    data.to_json
  end
end
```

Finally, specify `--metrics_log_formatter` when running a server:

```sh
anycable-go --metrics_log_formatter path/to/custom_printer.rb
```

#### Example

This a [Librato](https://www.librato.com)-compatible printer:

```ruby
module MetricsFormatter
  def self.call(data)
    parts = []

    data.each do |key, value|
      parts << "sample##{key}=#{value}"
    end

    parts.join(" ")
  end
end
```

```sh
INFO 2018-04-27T14:11:59.701Z sample#clients_num=0 sample#clients_uniq_num=0 sample#goroutines_num=0
```
