# RPC over HTTP

AnyCable supports RPC communication between a WebSocket server and your web application over HTTP (JSON). Although the default gRPC communication is more performant and, thus, preferred, it comes with a price of additional infrastructure complexityâ€”you have to manage a separate process/service.

HTTP RPC is a good alternative if you don't want to deal with gRPC or you are using a platform that doesn't support gRPC (e.g., Heroku, Google Cloud Run).

You can embed AnyCable HTTP RPC _server_ (a Rack application) into your Ruby or Rails application's web server (e.g., Puma) and serve AnyCable RPC requests from the same process.

## Using with Rails

To enable HTTP RPC in your Rails application, you must configure the `http_rpc_mount_path` parameter. For example, in your `config/anycable.yml`:

```yml
development:
  http_rpc_mount_path: "/_anycable"

production:
  http_rpc_mount_path: "/__some_other_anycable_path"
```

That's it! Now configure your WebSocket to perform RPC over HTTP at your mount path (e.g., `/_anycable`).

## Security

You can (and MUST in production) protect your HTTP RPC server with basic token-based authorization. To do so, you need to set the `http_rpc_secret` parameter (in YAML or via the `ANYCABLE_HTTP_RPC_SECRET` environment variable). Don't forget to set the same value in your WebSocket server configuration.

## Considerations

- **Performance**. HTTP/1 has a higher overhead than HTTP/2 used by gRPC, so you should expect a higher latency and lower throughput. Keep this in mind when choosing between HTTP RPC and gRPC.

- **Shared web server resources**. Rails applications have a limited HTTP concurrency (based on the total number of threads used by a web server, such as Puma), serving both regular HTTP requests and AnyCable RPC requests can result into a race for shared resources, and, in the worst case, longer request queuing times for user-facing HTTP operations.

- **Scalability**. It's not possible to scale AnyCable RPC requests separately from the main web application. If you need to scale AnyCable RPC requests independently, you should use gRPC.

## Using with Rack

You can mount AnyCable HTTP RPC server into your Rack application using the Rack Builder interface:

```ruby
Rack::Builder.new do
  map "/anycable" do
    run AnyCable::HTTPRC::Server.new
  end
end
```
