# AnyCable RPC benchmarks

AnyCable RPC server benchmarks.

The benchmark is pretty simple:
- Create N concurrent _clients_ (authenticate and subscribe to `BenchmarkChannel` within the RPC app)
- Every client starts performing an action (`echo`) in a loop
- Every call is collected (request time)
- Wait for the specified amount of seconds and aggregate the results.

Measuring **requests per seconds**.

**NOTE:** this benchmark shows performance characteristics for both _clients_ and the server.
The purpose of this benchmark is to measure the throughput of RPC connection between AnyCable services.

**NOTE 2:** "Noop RPC" is just a gRPC handling doing nothing except from responding with success result.

## Erlang single connection

RPC type \ Number of clients    |  1   | 10   | 50
--------------------------------|------|------|----
AnyCable RPC                    |  100 |  110 | 130
Noop RPC                        |  100 |  115 | 125

Erlang client definitely has problems(

Looks like HTTP2 streaming is working in _blocking mode_.

Requires investigation.
